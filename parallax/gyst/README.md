Coming out of college there are plenty of things to worry about, from finding a place to live, to getting a job. However, there is a slew of other important stuff, not mentioned in the classroom, that one will need to stay on their path to success. These include such things like filing taxes, dealing with insurance, and paying off loans. However, without prior knowledge of how to handle these things, many people have to traverse a mountain of  unnecessary information, to figure out what their needs are. Gyst exists to address this problem. Stemming from our frustration of figuring out student loans and taxes by ourselves, we created a system of tutorials and a knowledge base that seeks to educate young adults, without them having to swim through a tsunami of over complicated jaron or paying consulting fees.
