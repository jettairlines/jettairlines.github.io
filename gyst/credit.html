			<p>You’ve probably been swiping your credit card your entire life. Your parents ask about it once in awhile but whatever. But now, it’s different: you are paying the money you owe! And if you screw that up, it shall be none of their business :,^)</p>

		<h3> What are credits?</h3>
		<div>
			Your ability to buy stuff and not pay right away. If you don’t have any you are pretty screwed.
		</div>
		<h3> How do I build credits?</h3>
		<div>
			Your parents probably get everything started for you by getting you a credit card and paying your bills. If not, some banks have credit card plans that requires less prior credit, start there ASAP.
		</div>
		<h3> But my parents are no longer paying for me?</h3>
		<div>
			<ul><li>Pay your card in full: if you swipe what you can’t pay off, you’re screwed</li>
				<li>Check your banking page MORE often to know what’s going on</li>
				<li>Do not use ALL available credit on your card</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3> Should I get more credit cards than my parents gave me?</h3>
		<div>
			Yes. The better your credits are, the better choices you have. Here are some general types of card depending on your need:
			<ul><li>Standard(high/low interest)</li>
				
				<li>No credit/credit repair</li>
				
				<li>rewards/travel/cashback</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3> What is a good credit card?</h3>
