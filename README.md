**WARNING: This is not devpost, but I shall document here anyway just becasue I can.**

[jettairlines.github.io] is a product of my curiosity in parallax scrolling & vector art.

### Version
**v2.0**
- Mostly dumped bootstrap (recude HTML)
- Dynamically added Skrollr data attributes
- New & better vector art
- Took out most text, less responsive but prettier

### What I Learned


- [SkrollrJS]
- SaSS/SCSS
- Sketch 3 for art & web design
- gitignore & markdown & lisencing

### TODOs
- more stunning header
- better allocated element positions
- pause scroll to finish animation
- animate rainbow
- ditch bootstrap
- swap all img w/ svg
- return to responsive text(?)
